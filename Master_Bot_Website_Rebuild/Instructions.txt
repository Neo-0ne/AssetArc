    1. Import all TXT and ZIP files into your Notion workspace, WordPress environment, or backend system.
    2. Use MasterIndex.txt as a reference for bot structure.
    3. Each bot is self-contained. Refer to the YAML UI, JSON automation, Notion sync, and document output.
    4. Secure output and CRM sync must be activated per your integration platform (e.g. Notion API, Make.com).
    5. Use filenames with (2) suffixes for production control.
